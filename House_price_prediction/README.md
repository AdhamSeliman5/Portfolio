# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices using advanced regression techniques on the Kaggle dataset: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature engineering (HouseAge, TotalSF, TotalBathrooms, etc.)
- Log-transformation of SalePrice to improve model stability
- Linear Regression model achieving R² = 0.84 on hold-out data

## 📁 Structure
- `notebooks/`: model training and evaluation
- `data/`: raw dataset
- `submission/`: final predictions (if applicable)

## ✅ Result
Achieved a strong baseline with Linear Regression, ready to scale up to more advanced models like XGBoost or Lasso.
